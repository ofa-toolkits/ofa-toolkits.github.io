<p><strong>WHY COMMUNITY ACTION PLANNING MATTERS</strong></p>

<p>We want to ensure that we have a strong foundation for our organizing work, so it’s vital that we regroup, reconnect, and build our chapters and teams in communities across the country. We are the entry point for your network of friends, community groups, people who worked on the campaign, and all those who are ready to take action.</p>

<p>Our goal is to build relationships, and strengthen and expand our chapter membership by listening to people who are stepping up. We want to provide them with a menu of opportunities to get engaged in organizing work with OFA. As conveners in our communities, we want to bring people together, find out what their story is, what motivates them, what issues they care most about, and what changes they want to see in their neighborhoods.</p>

<p>We have the opportunity to be the model for what we want our communities to look like –– to show people that we are stronger together and that we respect, empower and include everyone.</p>

<h2 id="event-organizing-101">EVENT ORGANIZING 101</h2>

<p><strong>GETTING STARTED</strong></p>

<p>Great organizers build power by bringing people together. Organizers are able to connect people together from different backgrounds, experiences, and skill levels and put them to use in an effective and strategic way. By providing a space for people to meet, you can discuss the implications of actions taken by Congressional leaders and the administration for your community. From there, you can determine the next steps you can take as a group. By taking the time to collectively plan and strategize, you and your team will be able to move forward with a deliberate and thought-out approach.</p>

<p><strong>GOALS</strong></p>

<p>Your community action meeting should have the following goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Build a network of community members so you are ready to mobilize</p></li>

<li><p>Provide an outlet for people to channel their energy in a positive way</p></li>

<li><p>Identify the priority issues that need to be addressed in your community</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LOCK IN LOGISTICS</strong></p>

<p>Great organizers not only brainstorm creative and exciting ideas, but also invest a lot of time planning the different logistical aspects of their events and meetings. We will walk you through a number of steps to help you manage your event so you can achieve the above goals.</p>

<p><strong>When will you host your event?</strong> Give yourself enough time to find a location, plan and recruit for your event. Be sure to check calendars so your proposed date doesn’t interfere with holidays or important local events.</p>

<p><strong>Who will make up your planning team?</strong> Organizers work best in teams. Think about people who can help you organize your meeting and assign responsibilities accordingly. For example, someone might have time to bring snacks, so put them in charge of getting snacks for the meeting. Someone else may have a network of friends they have worked with on the campaign, so they can help with recruitment.</p>

<p><strong>RECRUITMENT REIGNS SUPREME</strong></p>

<p>Recruitment is one of your most important roles as a host. No meeting––no matter how well planned–– can truly be successful without people there to participate. At its core, organizing is fundamentally about building relationships. The larger and more cohesive a group of people are working together to make change, the more effective and powerful they will be.</p>

<p>The way to recruit effectively is not magic; there is a formula and key steps you must follow if you’re going to achieve your goals.</p>

<p>Recruiting someone to attend an event is not just getting a verbal commitment, or filling out a single online form. It is a continuous process of ensuring commitment all the way through the day of the meeting.</p>

<p><strong>The first ask is a registration</strong>, or RSVP. When asking for someone to join your meeting, your event info should include the specific location, time, and date of your meeting.</p>

<p><strong>The second ask is a confirmation</strong>. Every meeting will always have a number of people that are unable to make it, but by taking these steps, you can actively reduce that number:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>After the initial RSVP, you should send out a confirmation email and give them a phone call a week before your meeting.</p></li>

<li><p>Remind your guest of the upcoming meeting and tell them that you&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing them. Be sure to remind them of the date, time, and location of the event. Ask them if they have any questions as to the location or the agenda, and remind them that you&rsquo;ll give them a final reminder the day before the event.</p></li>

<li><p>You can also provide additional information––like specific directions or bringing a snack for a potluck</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*<em>Consider making it a potluck so that there are refreshments and light snacks, and everyone has a way to participate.</em></p>

<p><strong>The third ask is a final reminder.</strong> This is less of an ask and more of a friendly reminder. The day or two before the event takes place, it is always very helpful to send a reminder to confirmed participants that provides key details, dates and times, and what they should expect at the event. Again, this will help increase the attendance rate and reduce the number of people who don’t show up to your meeting.</p>

<p><strong>WHO TO INVITE?</strong></p>

<p>At OFA, we respect, empower and include everyone. We want to become the model for what we want our communities to be, so what does that look like for your area?</p>

<p>Start by making a list of people you know:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Friends and neighbors––people who may now be ready to take action</p></li>

<li><p>Faith or school groups and community organizations are also great resources</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Next, reach out to your community. You can find them by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Posting your event on <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/ofa-local-events?zipcode=60640&amp;country=US">OFA&rsquo;s website</a>. If you don’t have an account, click on the &ldquo;Sign In&rdquo; tab in the top right corner.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click on the “Host an Event” event button on the right hand side of the screen</p></li>

<li><p>Enter the title, date/time, and location of your event</p>

<ol>
<li>For the event title INSERT A SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. EXAMPLE: Join us for a community action meeting</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>Under the event description, you should add any specific details for your event that attendees need to know.</p>

<ol>
<li>EX: &ldquo;If you are ready to take action against efforts that strike at the heart of our shared values, then join us for an organizing meeting. We’ll be discussing the implications of recent actions for our community and plan our next steps.&rdquo;</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>Share your event to the relevant state group on<a href="https://act.ofaconnect.com"> Connect</a></p>

<ol>
<li><em>Connect is our online tool for volunteers to share information.</em></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>Others, such as people on Facebook or Twitter who want to take action</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Note: Be sure to direct message them</em></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GETTING YOUR DUCKS IN A ROW</strong></p>

<p>At the end of this host guide, you will find a few materials to make your experience as a host easier:</p>

<p><strong>Checklist:</strong> A checklist to help you organize your event. <em>You will not need everything on this list, but it’s a helpful guide to make sure you don’t forget anything!</em></p>

<p><strong>Agenda:</strong> A suggested outline of how your meeting could go</p>

<p><strong>Sign-in sheet:</strong> For attendees to check in so you have their contact information for the future</p>

<p><strong>THE DAY OF&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Be prepared before your first guest arrives!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set up your space early</p></li>

<li><p>If you have them, set out refreshments and snacks for your guests to help make them more comfortable and break the ice</p></li>

<li><p>Have your materials printed and ask people to sign in so you can have a record of all the guests who attend—it’ll help you follow up with folks after your event</p></li>

<li><p>Prepare your discussion <em>(some suggestions are below)</em></p></li>

<li><p>Set up 1:1 meetings with supporters who are ready to commit to take action</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few questions to help you focus your conversation and start planning to take action in your community. Remember to always respect, empower and include everyone and to encourage all your attendees to participate in the conversation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>What are the norms to set for your meeting?</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;Norms&rdquo; are basic (but necessary!) meeting guidelines, like “We won’t speak while someone else is talking.”</p></li>

<li><p>If everyone understands these norms up-front, it’s easier to guide your conversation back to them and make sure your meeting ends productively.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><em>What’s the experience level of people in the room?</em></p></li>

<li><p><em>What are you hoping to get out of joining OFA?</em></p></li>

<li><p><em>What issues are you interested in working on in your community?</em></p></li>

<li><p><em>What are the goals you would like to set for your group?</em></p></li>

<li><p><em>What actions could you and your group take this week? What are actions you can take in two weeks?</em></p></li>

<li><p><em>Who are the coalitions and partners you have or would like to work with?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>These relationships will be very important in the work to come, so having a good understanding of who they are and what the plan is to reach out to them is key.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><em>What other materials and resources do you need to be successful?</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AFTER YOUR MEETING</strong></p>

<p>Don’t forget your organizing fundamentals and follow up:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank your attendees</p>

<ul>
<li>Outline any next steps that were agreed upon at your meeting. Make sure to include the specific responsibilities that each volunteer agreed to take on––it’s a good idea to have these in writing to hold people accountable.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Follow up with 1:1 calls with prospective volunteers who did not sign up during your meeting</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>What’s a 1:1 and why do I need to do it?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>It is an intentional, pre-scheduled meeting (about 30-45 minutes)–– in this case, it’s likely an introductory 1:1. You can take the time to get to know someone on a much more personal level where you can share stories and really understand what is motivating them to get involved. 1:1s are about listening. The organizer or volunteer leader should absorb where the other person is coming from and seek to understand what they are saying.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Create and log your attendees information into a list so that you have a record of participants–– these may be the people who start a new chapter with you!</p></li>

<p><strong>2017 OFA COMMUNITY ACTION MEETING AGENDA</strong></p>

<p>*This is a suggestion*––<em>feel free to update or modify as needed.</em></p>

<p><strong>Welcome and Introduction (10 min.)</strong></p>

<p>Introduce yourself and ask your guests to sign in. Thank everyone for coming! Have your guests introduce themselves–this can just be their name as they can share more about themselves later on during the meeting.</p>

<p><strong>Share Your Story (5 min.)</strong></p>

<p>Take a couple minutes to share your own story and why you decided to host this meeting. Sharing personal stories is a great way to build relationships with guests and to create common experiences. It’s a good time to talk about the urgency of the moment and especially now, why it’s so important to continue to organize around the issues.</p>

<p><strong>Hear From Your Guests (20 min.)</strong></p>

<p>Use this opportunity to ask your guests to share their stories. Ask them about the issues they are most interested in organizing around. This gathering will be a great chance to brainstorm and discuss the issues and work that can most impact your community.</p>

<p><strong>Open Up the Discussion (30-40 min.)</strong></p>

<p>We are in a new and unexpected reality––probe for information that will help you grow your team and build your membership as well as help identify the needs in your community.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>See discussion questions above</em></li>
</ul>
