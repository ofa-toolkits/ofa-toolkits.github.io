      <description>Hosting Community Action Meetings WHY COMMUNITY ACTION PLANNING MATTERS
We want to ensure that we have a strong foundation for our organizing work, so itâ€™s vital that we regroup, reconnect, and build our chapters and teams in communities across the country. We are the entry point for your network of friends, community groups, people who worked on the campaign, and all those who are ready to take action.
Our goal is to build relationships, and strengthen and expand our chapter membership by listening to people who are stepping up.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
